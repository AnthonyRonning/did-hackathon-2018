# Goals for a BTCR playground

Here are some proposed goals for BTCR playgrounds and a programmer's tutorial in particular.

## Actions in any playground
What actions should be available in any BTCR playground?
1. create DID
2. validate DID (offline validation)
3. lookup DID
4. verify DID (including BTC check)
5. post DID indirectly
6. post DID directly (if possible)
7. revoke DID
8. rotate DID
9. test suite
10. test net v main net examples

## Programmer's tutorial
The goal of the tutorial is to walk a programmer through the parts of creating and using DIDs in a way that will make it easier for them to understand and use DIDs in their own work.

1. Present a programmable interface (sandbox)
2. Walk through from first principles through to constructing a working library
3. Provide exercises and worked-through examples
4. Be language specific (Joe is working on a JavaScript tutorial.)
